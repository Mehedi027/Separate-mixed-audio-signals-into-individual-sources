Separate mixed audio signals into individual sources, such as voices and background sounds (take the cocktail party effect into considerations).

This project aims to separate mixed audio signals into individual sources,
such as voices and background sounds, using machine learning techniques. I
explored the cocktail party effect and attempt to replicate it using neural networks. The
model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set, demonstrating its potential for
applications in speech recognition and audio editing.

To develop a model that can separate mixed audio signals into individual
sources, such as voices and background sounds.

The model is limited by the quality and diversity of the training data.
